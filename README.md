# Flocking in Paper.js
A simple example of flocking written in Paper.js. Based on the code from [Chapter 6 of Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/) by Daniel Shiffman.

[View example](https://reefscape.net/demo/paperjs-flocking/). Note that it might not be based on the latest version in the repository.

More features and optimization to be added later.
